Getting Started
---------------

Please follow the instructions provided by the instructor to start your
lab and access your jump host.

.. NOTE::
	 All work for this lab will be performed exclusively from the Windows
	 jumphost. No installation or interaction with your local system is
	 required.

Lab Network Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the interest of focusing as much time as possible on this solution,
we have provided some resources and basic setup ahead of time. These
are:

-  The system has been licensed and provisioned for LTM and APM

-  A Microsoft Active Directory environment has been configured for
   authentication

-  A working VMware Horizon View environment has already been configured

-  A working Citrix XenDesktop environment has already been configured

-  Windows desktops with Citrix and View clients will be accessed using
   RDP to demonstrate functionality

Connect to Lab Environment 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please refer to Figure 1. We are simulating internal and external access
to VDI with 2 Windows desktops. When viewing the “corporate-pc” session,
imagine you are sitting at your office desk. Likewise, viewing the
“home-pc” session is like you are sitting at home, or anywhere outside
of the company network.

The lab is hosted in a cloud provider Ravello. Lab instructors will
provide a URL and a unique student number to access the environment.
Each attendee is expected to have a computer with a modern browser and a
RDP client.

1. Open browser and go to the URL provided by instructor.

2. Scroll down and find “corporate-pc”. Choose to connect with RDP.
   Leave this connection for entire lab duration.
